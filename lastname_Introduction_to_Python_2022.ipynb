    "Python is a widely used, open source programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, as you noticed when you downloaded this software package, Python is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the basic plan is for you to get used to some of the basics of Python usage: how to use it as a fancy calculator, how to make simple plots, and how to debug when you get an error.\n",

    "You should also come in with your lab notebook (the physical notebook), which you’ll use for taking notes as you do the activity. It’s best to set up a table of contents and a starting page for this activity. Duplicate your prelab information on the starting page.\n",

Integers are whole numbers. Floating point numbers are ones where the number of figures to the right of the decimal varies based upon the value of the floating point number. If a whole number is written with no decimal point then Python treats it as an integer. If a number is written with a decimal point then Python treats it as a floating point number.

    "1) We have used the pound symbol (#) a few times in the cell. This symbol is used to indicate a _comment_. Comments are used to annotate your code to make them easier to read and understand. I have placed the comment Addition at the top so that you knew I would be performing that operation in that cell. I have also annotated the next two lines to indicate that I was adding integers and floating point numbers in the 2nd and 3rd lines, respectively. When you use the pound symbol, everything to the right of it is ignored by Python. If I hadn't used the pound symbols and had instead just tried to write Addition, integer, or floating point, Python would have given me an error.\n",

When we summed the two floating point numbers 5.0 and 10.0, we got 15.0. Older versions of Python would output integers if you perform a mathematical operation using only integers. However, this was changed in Python 3. Python will output floating point numbers if you have at least one floating point number in your calculation.\n",

You want to choose descriptive names for your variables, but you want to also keep variable names short since you will have to type them out each time you use them. Variables cannot have spaces in their names so dePaula is an acceptable variable, but de Paula is not. They cannot start with a number. Variables are case-sensitive, so x is a different variable than X. There are a number of words, such as print, that Python has reserved for special purposes; you cannot name your variable any of these reserved words. You will know you have typed a reserved word because it will appear green in your Notebook. Once a variable is assigned a value, it retains that value throughout a session until it is changed, thus you can use it in other cells."
